Put all these files in autoexecute (Except readme.md of course)

To set settings open settings.lua file and copy everything in here then u can set settings (Form,technique to use. Skills if it will work ofc)

But I prefer using another script to auto transform that I made in 30 seconds (if you use settings still set forms and technique cuz in case if it will work then u will untransform)

IF YOU DIE while fighting kefla then choose lower difficulty (if its lowest then get more lvl lol)
