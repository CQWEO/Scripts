------
Put all these files in autoexecute (Except readme.md of course)

------
Auto retry DOES WORK, it just dont shows that it pressed button, just calm down it does work (if it doesnt put a bit more task.wait(PutUrTimeHere)

--------
To set settings open settings.lua file and copy everything in here then u can set settings (Form,technique to use. Skills if it will work ofc)

But I prefer using another script to auto transform that I made in 30 seconds (if you use settings still set forms and technique cuz in case if it will work then u will untransform)

---
IF YOU DIE while fighting kefla then choose lower difficulty (if its lowest then get more lvl lol)

OR USE ultra instinct (technique or form, whatever u prefer)
yes ultra instinct rlly helps to survive

---

IF you see that script can break and dont tp to bosses (That are appear first, Kale and Cauflia. or if it happens at Kefla then open issue request or type in our discord, to get in discord use blade ball script fr) and kill them then put a task.wait(PutTimeHere) before a script

Ex:

task.wait(5)

--Script Here (Without "--")
